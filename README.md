## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a mechanical engineer turned software and hardware developer with a passion for building full-stack systems—from microcontrollers to GUIs to data dashboards.

- I work in advanced manufacturing, developing control systems and analyzing machine data.
- I build custom software tooling, applications, and firmware, often using Rust for high-performance and reliability.
- I love to learn technical tidbits around embedded systems, networking, computer vision, and engineering. 
- In my free time, I love to go bouldering, walking the dogs, and gaming.
